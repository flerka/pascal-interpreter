# Simple Pascal Interpreter with C#
Work in progress - 7/19.

This repository contains a simple pascal interpreter written with C#. Code is based on https://ruslanspivak.com/ article's series ["Letâ€™s Build A Simple Interpreter"](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/). I rewrote examples with C# instead of Python. 

Each folder has an example for the specific part of the series.
