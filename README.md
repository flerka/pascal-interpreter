# Simple Pascal Interpreter with C#
Work in progress - 7/19.

Simple pascal interpreter written with C#. This repository is based on [https://ruslanspivak.com/ series](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) of articles "Letâ€™s Build A Simple Interpreter". I rewrote examples with C# instead of Python. 

Each folder has example for specific part of the series.

Work in progress.
